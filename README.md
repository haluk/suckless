I use [dwm-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch), [st-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/st-flexipatch), [dmenu-flexipath](https://github.com/bakkeby/dmenu-flexipatch) projects to build my dwm, st, and dmenu.
[flexipath-finalizer](https://github.com/bakkeby/flexipatch-finalizer) is used to remove non-selected patches.
